# ProofAna HEP analysis framework based on [ROOT] (http://root.cern.ch)

This is my personal repository for the framework code. Analysis-specific code is separate. The framework was developed during my time as a graduate student and post-doc on the ATLAS experiment. Comments/questions please contact [Bart Butler] (mailto:bart.c.butler@gmail.com).
